    The Winter season had just ended. It was the very beginning of Spring though there were still the feel of Winter
    outside Dhaka. I was planning to visit Mymensingh for a long time but unfortunately, it was just in the plan.
    Finally, I took the action to visit. Luckily, I have a brother who has just finished his Masters in Bangladesh
    Agricultural University(BAU), Mymensingh.

    Although Mymensingh is the capital of the Mymensingh Division of Bangladesh, it is not a much-visited city as far
    as I know. So, I visited the city without any expectation as It was just a plan to visit all the remarkable cities
    of my own country, not to see any particular thing. I visited there just see the city, the livelihood of people
    and some unknown but remarkable places. The city is located on the Brahmaputra River, not very far from Dhaka, the
    capital of Bangladesh.

    Train From Dhaka to Mymensingh
    I bought a ticket for train Tista that left the Airport Railway station at 8:00 AM. It was quite an early morning
    for me as I am not an early bird. To my surprise, when I got out of the home to reach the station I found Dhaka
    already well awaken. Dhaka is another city that doesn't sleep. The train was on time, it was leaving Dhaka behind
    and instead of using any smart device I kept my eye opened looking outside through the window beside me. As soon
    as the train passes the busy atmosphere of Dhaka, the weather got changed! Seems like outside of Dhaka was still
    sleeping, there was still fogs out there to cover the asleep trees and grass from our sight. I was having a
    feeling of going near nature to breathe natural air...

    Fog from train
    The train reached Mymensingh station at around 11:00 AM being almost 40 minutes late. I think this delay was due
    to fogs on the road. By the way, my brother was standing in the station to receive me. This was the starting of
    mission Mymensingh!

    <code>
      <pre>
          #include<stdio.h>
          int main():void
          {
            printf("Hello world");
          }
      </pre>
    </code>

    Bangladesh Agricultural University(BAU)
    From the station, we went straight to BAU, one of the biggest agricultural universities in Asia. The university is
    so big that I don't have enough time to visit even just interesting things about the university on foot.
    Therefore, we took the traditional vehicle of Bangladesh, rickshaw. We visited places like Fish Museum
    Biodiversity Center(FMBC), the road that contains lines of mango trees in two sides then blackberry trees then
    litchi trees!
